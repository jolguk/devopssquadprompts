# We have realised that some of the current opposition to adoption of GitHub Copilot could be addressed with Prompt Engineering. For Chats and Hacks October 2024 we would like to work on writing some example prompts for some of the problem issues customers have raised with us. 

How to avoid  CoPilot giving a suggestion of Insecure code?

How to avoid CoPilot giving a suggestion of over complex code?

How to avoid CoPilot giving a suggestion of not performant code?

How to enforce not getting CoPilot to generate BOTH the â€˜Test code AND the Application code) (effectively AI testing AI)

The Code review tool is perceived as not yet adequate.  What prompts can we use to help it ?

How can we get Copilot to produce more accurate and relevant responses? 

How can we have better control over the versions of software Copilot uses? 

How can we improve the quality of unit tests it produces?
